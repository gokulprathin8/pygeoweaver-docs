import pygeoweaver
```

2. Create a process using the `create_process` function. This function allows you to define the programming language, description, name, code, and other optional parameters for the process. Here's an example:

```python
process = pygeoweaver.create_process(
    lang="python",
    description="My first Pygeoweaver process",
    name="Process 1",
    code="""
        # Your process code here
    """
)
```

3. Explore the functionalities and methods provided by Pygeoweaver to work with processes, workflows, and other geoweaver-related tasks. Refer to the [API Reference](/docs/getting-started.md) for detailed information on available classes and methods.
